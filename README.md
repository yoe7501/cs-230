Summary
The Gaming Room Client and Software Requirements
The Gaming Room wanted us to design a game that works on multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile devices). The game needed to handle multiple teams and players, with only one game instance in memory at any time. Our design had to use proven design patterns to make the game scalable and maintainable.

What I Did Well
I did a good job detailing the technical needs and design limits. By clearly explaining the use of design patterns and ensuring unique instances for games, teams, and players, I set up a strong foundation for development. I also provided a thorough evaluation of the different operating platforms.

Helpful Aspects of the Design Document
Creating the design document helped me organize the development process. It gave a clear plan to follow, making sure all technical and user requirements were covered. This step helped me spot and plan for potential challenges early on, making the coding process smoother.

What I'd Revise
If I could revise one part of the document, I'd improve the System Architecture View. Even though it wasn't required, adding more details and diagrams about the system’s structure and data flow would have made the architecture clearer and more helpful for developers.

Interpreting User Needs
I turned the user’s needs into technical requirements by analyzing what they wanted and translating it into the design. This ensured the software met their expectations and was user-friendly. Understanding user needs is crucial because it directly affects how well the final product works for them.

Approach to Designing Software
I used a step-by-step approach, starting with gathering requirements, analyzing constraints, evaluating platforms, and detailing the domain model. I focused on using design patterns, ensuring scalability, and maintaining security. In future projects, I’ll keep using these strategies and also include more feedback from stakeholders and iterative prototyping to continuously improve the design.
